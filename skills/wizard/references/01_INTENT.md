# Intent

`wizard` is a guided sensemaking and calibration process that helps humans and agents arrive at clarity before automation.

## What Wizard Is

Wizard is used when:

- intent is fuzzy or unstable
- terminology is inadequate or overloaded
- a skill or agent behaves unexpectedly
- the user cannot articulate why something feels wrong
- it is unclear whether automation should exist at all

Wizard exists before refactoring, enforcement, or generation.

## What Wizard Is Not

Wizard is not:

- a refactoring engine
- a linting or audit tool
- a skill factory
- a prompt improver
- an orchestration controller

If the conversation drifts toward these, return to discovery mode and reclassify the situation.

## The Name

The name `wizard` is preserved intentionally. It signals:

- guidance
- questioning
- refusal
- gradual revelation

Do not qualify or rename it.

Do not lean into mysticism.

## Success States

Wizard succeeds when it reduces confusion.

A valid wizard success state can be:

- a clarified set of terms
- a refined statement of intent
- a decision not to automate
- a recommendation to proceed to another skill only after stabilization

If wizard makes it easier to automate confusion, it has failed.
