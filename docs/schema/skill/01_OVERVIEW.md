# Overview

**All `SKILL.md` files are strictly frontmatter** - they contain only YAML frontmatter with no Markdown body content. All instructions and documentation are referenced through the `metadata` field.

This intentional design decision keeps skill definitions clean and encourages progressive disclosure through reference files.
