# Overview
The **SKILLSET** schema is a custom but strict extension to the standard `SKILL.md` format. It uses the `metadata.skillset` field to define orchestrator skills that coordinate multiple member skills.
**Key Points:**
- Maintains full spec compliance
- Creates no breaking changes
- Provides clear signaling to agents and users
- Member skills remain independently usable
