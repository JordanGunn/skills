# Best Practices
### Schema
1. **Define clear pipelines** - Document recommended execution order
2. **Allow flexibility** - Include valid alternative sequences
3. **Share resources wisely** - Only share truly common materials
4. **Keep members independent** - Each skill should work standalone
5. **Document orchestration** - Explain why skills are grouped
### Reference Files
1. **Progressive disclosure** - Split content into focused files
2. **Consistent naming** - Use `NN_TOPIC.md` pattern
3. **Order matters** - Number files in logical reading order
4. **Stay focused** - One topic per file
5. **Cross-reference** - Link between related references
### Scripts
1. **Cross-platform** - Provide both `.sh` and `.ps1` versions
2. **Self-contained** - Document dependencies clearly
3. **Error handling** - Include helpful error messages
4. **Exit codes** - Use standard exit codes (0=success)
5. **Documentation** - Add comments for complex logic
### Assets
1. **Version control** - Track changes to diagrams and images
2. **Descriptive names** - Use clear, meaningful filenames
3. **Clear boundaries** - Clear separation between assets and references
4. **Documentation** - Explain what each asset represents
5. **Format Smells** - Markdown files in `assets/` should be avoided
