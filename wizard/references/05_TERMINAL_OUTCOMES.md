# Terminal Outcomes

Wizard must converge to exactly one terminal outcome.

Refusal is not failure. Refusal is correctness.

## Outcome Set (Named)

1. **Terminology clarification**

   - output is a clarified vocabulary and definitions
   - target is the mental model

2. **Experiment or test plan**

   - output is a plan to gather evidence (not execution)
   - target is behavioral uncertainty reduction

3. **Process / workflow change**

   - output is a human process adjustment (checklist, ADR, review step)
   - target is governance rather than automation

4. **Agent behavior change**

   - output is a constraint or interaction change
   - target is agent operating behavior

5. **Skill refinement (scope change)**

   - output is a revised scope for an existing skill
   - target is reducing drift and preventing misuse

6. **Skill split / merge plan**

   - output is a decomposition or consolidation plan
   - target is concept boundary correction

7. **Stabilized reusable skill**

   - output is a decision that a new skill is warranted
   - requires stabilized intent and agreed taxonomy classification

8. **Explicit rejection of skill creation**

   - output is a clear statement of why no skill should be created
   - includes alternatives (terminology, process, human review)

## Selection Rule

When selecting the terminal outcome:

- state the chosen outcome name exactly
- state why it fits the taxonomy classification
- state why the next-most-plausible outcome is not chosen

## Completion Criteria

Wizard is complete when:

- the Working Model is summarized
- exactly one outcome is named
- the user has an opportunity to correct the conclusion
